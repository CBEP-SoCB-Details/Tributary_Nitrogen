# Concentrations on Nitrogen in Casco Bay Tributaries

## Data Sources

"summary_tables_from_gray_2019.xls"
The data in this Excel file were copied by hand from Whitley Gray's masters
thesis. Most of the data was drawn from tables 1, 3, and 6 in the document, but
some figures were included in the text, but not explicitly in tables.  See notes
and the Metadata tab in the Excel spreadsheet for additional notes and details.

CBEP received a copy of Whitley Gray's masters thesis, on which these
graphics and analyses are based.  A copy is included in the 'Original_Data'
folder.  The thesis can also be downloaded from either the 
[CBEP website](https://www.cascobayestuary.org/publication/improved-estimates-of-tributary-nitrogen-load-to-casco-bay-maine/)
or the 
[University of Maine Digital Commons] (https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/etd/3087/).
