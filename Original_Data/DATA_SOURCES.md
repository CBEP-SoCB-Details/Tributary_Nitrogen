# Concentrations on Nitrogen in Casco Bay Tributaries

## Data Sources
The source of these data was a study conducted by Whitley Gray, 
as a portion of her graduate studies at the University of Maine.
She collected surface water samples from three tributaries to Casco Bay
in 2017 and 2018, and measured Total Nitrogen (TN), 
Nitrate + Nitrite nitrogen ("NOx"), and ammonium nitrogen (NH4).  She calculated 
 organic nitrogen as the difference between TN and inorganic nitrogen
 (NOx + NH4).  All values are expressed in in mg/l as N.
  
Gray sent the file "2017-18 Casco Bay Tributary Nitrogen Concentrations.xlsx" to
Curtis Bohlen, Karen Wilson, Damian Brady, and Angie Brewer via e-mail 
on April 3, 2019.  It contains average values of six laboratory measurements
(three laboratory replicates of each of two field  samples).  Values match 
results reported in Table 2 of Gray's thesis.

CBEP received a copy of Gray's masters thesis, which provides details
on the study, directly from her via e-mail.  The thesis can also be downloaded
from either the [CBEP website](https://www.cascobayestuary.org/publication/improved-estimates-of-tributary-nitrogen-load-to-casco-bay-maine/)
or the [University of Maine Digital Commons] (https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/etd/3087/).
