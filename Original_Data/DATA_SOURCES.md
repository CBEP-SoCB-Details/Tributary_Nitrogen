# Concentrations on Nitrogen in Casco Bay Tributaries

## Data Sources
The source of these data was a study conducted by Whitley Gray, 
as a portion of her graduate studies at the University of Maine.
She collected surface water saamples from three tributaries to Casco Bay
in 2017 and 2018, and measured organic nitrogen ("Organic"), 
Nitrate + Nitrite nitrogen ("NOx"), ammonium nitrigen (NH4) and summed 
those measurements to estimate total total nitrogen (TN), in mg/l.
  
Gray sent the file "2017-18 Casco Bay Tributary Nitrogen Concentrations.xlsx" to
Curtis Bohlen, Karen Wilson, Damian Brady, and Angie Brewer via e-mail 
on April 3, 2019.

CBEP received a copy of Gray's masters thesis, which provides details on the study,
directly from her via e-mail on 9/18/2019. Although the file says "draft" this was 
cc'd to Curtis Bohlen in an E-mail titled "Re:Final w.edits", and thus appears to 
be the final version.
